The overall algorithm takes in the .csv of the flighs, and converts it to a DataFrame using pandas. When working with the data, it is converted to a list of lists, for easier indexing.

The program begins with automatic mode, which calculates the best month to schedule a flight based on a ranking.
 The ranking is determined by an average of flight specifications for that month. 
    To determine the rank for each flight, the program will divide the flights performed by the flights scheduled for that row. 
    The program will then multiply that percentage by the number of available seats (seats - passengers) to find the rank for that row.
    Once all the ranks are added up for each month, it will divide that rank by the number of rows to find the average for the month.

When the average percentages and average ranks are determined, the month will be sorted by the average rank, and displayed to the user.

For manual mode, there exists a set of options to the user, who can filter out desired attributes to get a list of flights that are best for that attribute (or some combination of these)

In main.pyw, comment out line 122 to enable manual mode (there are currently graphical issues that need to be worked out).
