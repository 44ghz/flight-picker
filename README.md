# flight-picker

Written in Python, this program will take in data from an input .csv file and determine the best flight options based on the criteria provided by the user.
Utilizing TKinter, there will be a GUI to accompany the program.

There are two modes in which the program will run:
MODE 1: Automatic. The criteria are predetermined and the result is changed within source.
MODE 2: Manual. The user selects the criteria for the flight.

The list of effects on the flight chosen is as follows:
Distance
Carrier
Origin City
Destination City
Aircraft
Month
State
and at least three combinations of these.

Any flight that had flown but was not scheduled will not be included, as the user could not have booked it.
